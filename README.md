# Depthcast
### Classes for Depthcast Unity

This repo is used for managing pull requests before class file changes can be propagated to our Depthcast Master project. 
The rest of Unity files will be tracked using Collab (in a Dev and Master project).

This repo should exist in the "Scripts" folder of the Depthcast Development project.

## Pull Requests
- It should be one person's job to transfer the contents of the current Development (Collab) project to a feature branch here, and at some point stop development to do a "all hands on deck" pull request and code review.
- When the feature branch gets pulled into Master, it should also mark when the current Development (Collab) project can be copied and transferred to the Master (Collab) project. 
- From that point forward the project manager should do a Git pull on master, and then on the next collab update begin a new feature branch again.
